## Teaching Tips

---

### Old ways
Demonstrate the previous way of doing things, before demonstrating what the shortcut/hotkeys does.

### Keyboard Proficiency

Please note that not all students are not 100% proficient with their keyboards. So it's likely they need time to adapt round ways to work more efficiently as they currently do already.

### Shortcut of the Week!

Learning new things can be at best a daunting if the topic discussed isn't interesting or at worst scary. 

Teach a useful shortcut to them per week, rather than brain dumping a load of commands on them.

You can go one step further and let know what you are doing, and why you use the shortcut you use.

### Pair Up!

Some shortcuts are best learnt in pairs, a few examples. Especially the ones where the user has the opportunity to undo a mistake

- Copy & Paste

- Open new tab & Close tab

- Undo & Redo
