# Learning Best Practices

Learning can be tough, however sometimes it's best to learn the hard way to make life easier later on.

- Move slow to go fast. Slow down when learning it's not a race, learning is more a marathon

- Learn from documentation and experimention, not just tutorials

- Try to avoid watching videos, try practicing and reading documentation first

- Not sure what to do, try Rubber Ducking

- Don't copy & paste, learn and practice doing it.

- It's okay to make a mistake, what matters most is how you learn from that mistake

- Use **Discover** → **Analzye** → **Test** cycle

- Create a testable + feedback environment - helps you know when something is wrong

  - Use inspect for HTML & CSS

  - Use the terminal & console.log for JS
